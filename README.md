**Deskly**, an ERP I‚Äôm building to make life easier for freelancers and micro/small businesses. My goal is to create a simple, free, and intuitive platform that helps manage all aspects of a freelance gig or small business‚Äîfrom clients and projects to finances and resources‚Äîall in one place. I hope I can create a tool that solves real problems for independent professionals, artists, and small teams.

## The Idea Behind Deskly

As a small business owner and freelancer myself, I‚Äôve experienced firsthand how chaotic and overwhelming it can feel to manage everything on your own‚Äîor with just a tiny team. The lists of worries and tasks seem endless: keeping track of clients, meeting project deadlines, managing finances, organizing resources, and so much more. It‚Äôs a lot, and it can feel like you‚Äôre drowning in responsibilities. That‚Äôs why I started Deskly: to build a tool that simplifies the day-to-day tasks of running a freelance gig or a small business. I want Deskly to be the go-to solution for freelancers, artists, and micro/small businesses who need to:

- Keep track of client details, interactions, and project statuses.
- Set deadlines, monitor progress, and manage tasks across multiple projects.
- Create invoices, track expenses, and manage financials.
- Organize resources like time, materials, or team availability.
- Share files with clients or team members directly in the app.
- Get a quick overview of income, expenses, deadlines, and tasks through a custom dashboard.

My vision is to make Deskly a free, user-friendly ERP that freelancers and small business owners can rely on, without the complexity or cost of other tools on the market. I hope Deskly can help ease the burden for all those independent professionals and small teams who are struggling to keep everything under control.

- **Frontend**: I‚Äôm using React, Bootstrap, and Vite to build a clean and responsive landing page.
- **Backend**: I‚Äôm working on a backend with Python, Flask, JWT for authentication, and PostgreSQL for data storage.

## A Project in Active Development

Deskly is still a work in progress! I‚Äôm currently working on the backend to make Deskly fully functional, with plans to add user authentication, financial tracking, resource management, and advanced reporting tools. I‚Äôm also exploring ways to polish the design. Stay tuned for updates as I keep building!

## Why I‚Äôm Building This

I‚Äôm developing Deskly to test my skills as a developer while creating a tool I‚Äôd actually use myself. I‚Äôve focused on a clean, user-friendly design. I‚Äôve also ensured it‚Äôs fully responsive, so it looks great on any device. I‚Äôm always open to feedback and new perspectives.
