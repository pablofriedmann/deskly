**Deskly** is an ERP I’m building to make life easier for freelancers and micro/small businesses. My goal is to create a simple, free, and intuitive platform that helps manage all aspects of a freelance gig or small business — from clients and projects to finances and resources — all in one place. I hope to create a tool that solves real problems for independent professionals, artists, and small teams.

## The Idea Behind Deskly

As a small business owner and freelancer myself, I’ve experienced firsthand how chaotic and overwhelming it can feel to manage everything on your own — or with just a tiny team. The list of worries and tasks seems endless: keeping track of clients, meeting project deadlines, managing finances, organizing resources, and so much more.

That’s why I started Deskly: to build a tool that simplifies the day-to-day tasks of running a freelance gig or a small business.

### What Deskly Will Help With

- Keep track of client details, interactions, and project statuses  
- Set deadlines, monitor progress, and manage tasks across multiple projects  
- Create invoices, track expenses, and manage financials  
- Organize resources like time, materials, or team availability  
- Share files with clients or team members directly in the app  
- Get a quick overview of income, expenses, deadlines, and tasks through a custom dashboard  

My vision is to make Deskly a free, user-friendly ERP that freelancers and small business owners can rely on — without the complexity or cost of other tools on the market.

## A Project in Active Development

Deskly is actively being developed. I’ve recently completed the core frontend features, including a functional dashboard, client and task management, and a polished design with animations and dark mode.

Next steps include implementing project management, financial tools, and resource management — followed by backend integration with Flask, JWT, and PostgreSQL.

## Why I’m Building This

I’m developing Deskly to test my skills as a developer while creating a tool I’d actually use myself. I’ve focused on a clean, user-friendly design and ensured it’s fully responsive, so it looks great on any device. I’m always open to feedback and new perspectives.
